Chinese Character Analysis

This is a simple program for analyzing the difficulty of Chinese articles for young kids in learning Mandarin Chinese.
This is a GUI program and MVC models are used in OOD programming.

* What it does?

The program first loads several dictionaries, each of which contain a number of Chinese characters. Then the user input
an Chinese article and the program will calculate the percentage of Chinese characters not in the dictionaries. Further,
the program highlight those characters.

* Usage:

1. Directly copy the "test" folder to your local machine
2. Find the "dictlist.txt" file which specifies dictionary names. A maximum of 6 dictionaries is allowed at this moment.
3. So far, dictionaries must be in the folder "dict" (will be improved later). You can edit any one of them by adding or removing any Chinese characters.
4. After you configured the dictionaries you can double click the textAnalyzer.jar file to run the program.
